# Bad UI: QR Captcha

Trace a QR code and scan it to proceed.

## Notes

- back.js is not hosted with GitHub pages. Start it using **node.js**.
- If you want to selfhost this, update **/main.js** and **/check/index.html** files to use your correct WS data.
- Don't forget to create a new cut QR code if you want to selfhost. Put the image parts in **/imgs/**.
